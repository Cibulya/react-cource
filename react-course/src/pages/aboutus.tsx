                Initial D (Japanese: 頭文字イニシャル D, Hepburn: Inisharu Dī)
                is a Japanese street racing manga series written and illustrated
                by Shuichi Shigeno. It was serialized in Kodansha`s seinen manga
                magazine Weekly Young Magazine from 1995 to 2013, with the
                chapters collected into 48 tankōbon volumes. The story focuses
                on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the
                action is concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in
                cities or urban areas, and with the drifting racing style
                emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver and
                pioneer of drifting Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial
                supervision. The story is centered on the prefecture of Gunma,
                more specifically on several mountains in the Kantō region and
                in their surrounding cities and towns. Although some of the
                names of the locations the characters race in have been
                fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on
                actual locations in Japan. Initial D has been adapted into
                several anime television and original video animations series by
                OB Studio Comet, Studio Gallop, Pastel, A.C.G.T and SynergySP. A
                live action film by Avex and Media Asia was released in 2005.
                Both the manga and anime series were initially licensed for
                English-language distribution in North America by Tokyopop
                (2002–2009). However, the anime license has since been picked up
                by Funimation (now Crunchyroll), while the manga was relicensed
                by Kodansha USA in 2019. As of April 2021, Initial D had over 55
                million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling
                manga series in history.
